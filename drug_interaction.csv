0,100-0-d00001,197-0-d03983,acyclovir,ampicillin/probenecid,Minor,"The coadministration of probenecid and acyclovir may result in elevated plasma concentrations of acyclovir.  In 3 subjects with normal renal function, probenecid 1 gram increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and terminal plasma half-life of acyclovir (5 mg/kg intravenously) by an average of 40% and 18%, respectively.  Renal clearance decreased an average of 32%.  The mechanism is competitive inhibition of acyclovir renal tubular secretion by probenecid.  Although this interaction is unlikely to be of clinical significance, caution may be advisable if acyclovir is used concomitantly with probenecid.","['Laskin OL, de Miranda P, King DH, et al. ""Effects of probenecid on the pharmacokinetics and elimination of acyclovir in humans."" Antimicrob Agents Chemother 21 (1982): 804-7']"

In addition, the risk of QT interval prolongation and arrhythmias (e.g. torsades de pointes) due to sotalol may be increased by potassium-depleting diuretics.

MANAGEMENT:  Monitoring of serum potassium levels, blood pressure, and blood glucose is recommended during coadministration.  Patients should be advised to seek medical assistance if they experience dizziness, weakness, fainting, fast or irregular heartbeats, or loss of blood glucose control.","['Dornhorst A, Powell SH, Pensky J ""Aggravation by propranolol of hyperglycaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide in type II diabetics without alteration of insulin secretion.""

2,100-0-d00001,494-0-d03566,acyclovir,captopril/hydrochlorothiazide,Moderate,"MONITOR:  Although they are frequently combined in clinical practice, diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may have additive effects.  Coadministration makes hypotension and hypovolemia more likely than does either drug alone.  Some ACE inhibitors may attenuate the increase in the urinary excretion of sodium caused by some loop diuretics.  Some patients on diuretics, especially those on dialysis or a dietary salt restriction, may experience acute hypotension with lightheadedness and dizziness after receiving the first dose of the ACE inhibitor.  In addition, ACE inhibitors may cause renal insufficiency or acute renal failure in patients with sodium depletion or renal artery stenosis.  

MANAGEMENT:  Monitoring of blood pressure, diuresis, electrolytes, and renal function is recommended during coadministration.  The possibility of first-dose hypotensive effects may be minimized by initiating therapy with small doses of the ACE inhibitor, or either discontinuing the diuretic temporarily or increasing the salt intake approximately one week prior to initiating  an ACE inhibitor.  Alternatively, the patient may remain under medical supervision for at least two hours after the first dose of the ACE inhibitor, or until blood pressure has stabilized.","['Reader C, Peyregne EA, Suarez LD ""Amrinone therapy in congestive cardiomyopathy.""

Sedation and impairment of attention, judgment, thinking, and psychomotor skills may increase.

MANAGEMENT:  During concomitant use of these drugs, patients should be monitored for potentially excessive or prolonged CNS and respiratory depression.  Cautious dosage titration may be required, particularly at treatment initiation.  Ambulatory patients should be counseled to avoid hazardous activities requiring mental alertness and motor coordination until they know how these agents affect them, and to notify their physician if they experience excessive or prolonged CNS effects that interfere with their normal activities.","['Hamilton MJ, Bush M, Smith P, Peck AW ""The effects of bupropion, a new antidepressant drug, and diazepam, and their interaction in man.""
