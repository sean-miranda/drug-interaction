0,amiodarone,Major,"GENERALLY AVOID:  Grapefruit juice may significantly increase the plasma concentrations of orally administered amiodarone.  The proposed mechanism is inhibition of CYP450 3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism in the gut wall by certain compounds present in grapefruits.  In 11 nonsmoking, healthy volunteers, grapefruit juice (300 mL with drug administration, then 3 hours and 9 hours later) increased the mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of amiodarone (17 mg/kg single dose) by 84% and 50%, respectively, compared to water.  Formation of the pharmacologically active metabolite, N-desethylamiodarone (N-DEA), was completely inhibited.  Clinically, this interaction can lead to altered efficacy of amiodarone, since antiarrhythmic properties of amiodarone and N-DEA appear to differ.  In the study, mean increases in PR and QTc intervals of 17.9% and 11.3%, respectively, were observed 6 hours postdose with water, while increases of 10.2% and 3.3%, respectively, were observed after administration with grapefruit juice.

ADJUST DOSING INTERVAL:  Food increases the rate and extent of absorption of amiodarone.  The mechanism appears to involve the effect of food-induced physiologic changes on drug release from its formulation.  In 30 healthy volunteers, administration of a single 600 mg dose of amiodarone following a high-fat meal resulted in a Cmax and AUC that were 3.8 and 2.4 times the respective values under fasting conditions.  The time to reach peak plasma concentration (Tmax) was decreased by 37%, indicating an increased rate of absorption.  Mean Cmax and AUC for the active metabolite, N-DEA, also increased by 32% and 55%, respectively, but there was no change in the Tmax.

MANAGEMENT:  Patients treated with oral amiodarone should avoid consumption of grapefruits and grapefruit juice.  In addition, oral amiodarone should be administered consistently with regard to meals.","['""Product Information. Cordarone (amiodarone).""

4,atenolol,Moderate,"GENERALLY AVOID:  Orange juice may moderately reduce the bioavailability of atenolol by interfering with its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.  In a pharmacokinetic study, subjects ingested 200 mL orange juice 3 times daily for 3 days and twice daily on the fourth day, and took 50 mg atenolol with 200 mL orange juice on day 3.  The average peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of atenolol fell by 49% and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) fell by 40% in comparison to subjects who drank only water.  In addition, the presence of food may reduce the bioavailability of atenolol by 20%.  The clinical significance is unknown.  

MANAGEMENT:  Patients treated orally with atenolol should be advised to take atenolol at the same time each day and to avoid consumption of large amounts of orange juice to prevent any undue fluctuations in serum drug levels.  Monitoring for altered efficacy of atenolol may be advisable.","['Lilja JJ, Raaska K, Neuvonen PJ ""Effects of orange juice on the pharmacokinetics of atenolol."" Eur J Clin Pharmacol  (2005):']"

6,captopril,Moderate,"GENERALLY AVOID:  Moderate-to-high dietary intake of potassium can cause hyperkalemia in some patients who are using angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.  In some cases, affected patients were using a potassium-rich salt substitute.  ACE inhibitors can promote hyperkalemia through inhibition of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin (RAA) system.

8,ciprofloxacin,Moderate,"ADJUST DOSING INTERVAL:  Concurrent ingestion of dairy products (milk, yogurt) or calcium-fortified foods (i.e., cereal, orange juice) may decrease the activity of certain oral fluoroquinolone antibiotics.  The mechanism is chelation of calcium and the quinolone, resulting in decreased bioavailability.  In the case of orange juice, inhibition of intestinal transport mechanisms (P-glycoprotein or organic anion-transporting polypeptides) by flavones may also be involved.  One study reported an average 41% decrease in maximum plasma concentrations and a 38% decrease in AUC when ciprofloxacin was given with calcium-fortified orange juice instead of water.  Administration of ciprofloxacin tablets with enteral nutrition may reduce its bioavailability and maximum serum concentrations.  Data have been conflicting and variable by the type of enteral nutrition product, location of the feeding tube, and patient characteristics.  Decreased absorption is expected if ciprofloxacin is given by jejunostomy tube.  

MANAGEMENT:  Oral ciprofloxacin should not be taken with dairy products or calcium-fortified foods alone, but may be taken with meals that contain these products.  When taken alone, dairy products or calcium-fortified foods should be ingested at least 2 hours before or after ciprofloxacin administration.  When ciprofloxacin tablets are administered to patients receiving continuous enteral nutrition, some experts recommend that the tube feeding should be interrupted for at least 1 hour before and 2 hours after the dose of ciprofloxacin is given.  Patients should be monitored for altered antimicrobial efficacy and switched to intravenous ciprofloxacin if necessary.  If no enteral route besides a jejunostomy tube is available, it is also recommended to switch to intravenous ciprofloxacin.  According to the manufacturer, ciprofloxacin oral suspension should not be administered via nasogastric or feeding tubes due to its physical characteristics.","['""Product Information.
