0,phenelzine,Major,"CONTRAINDICATED:  Foods that contain large amounts of tyramine may precipitate a hypertensive crisis in patients treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).  The mechanism is inhibition of MAO-A, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing exogenous amines such as tyramine in the gut and preventing them from being absorbed intact.  Once absorbed, tyramine is metabolized to octopamine, a substance that is believed to displace norepinephrine from storage granules.  

GENERALLY AVOID:  Alcohol may potentiate some of the pharmacologic effects of MAOIs.  Use in combination may result in additive central nervous system depression and/or impairment of judgment, thinking, and psychomotor skills.

MANAGEMENT:  In general, patients treated with MAOIs or other agents that possess MAOI activity (e.g., furazolidone, linezolid, procarbazine) should avoid consumption of products that contain large amounts of amines and protein foods in which aging or breakdown of protein is used to increase flavor.  These foods include cheese (particularly strong, aged or processed cheeses), sour cream, wine (particularly red wine), champagne, beer, pickled herring, anchovies, caviar, shrimp paste, liver (particularly chicken liver), dry sausage, salamis, figs, raisins, bananas, avocados, chocolate, soy sauce, bean curd, sauerkraut, yogurt, papaya products, meat tenderizers, fava bean pods, protein extracts, yeast extracts, and dietary supplements.  Caffeine may also precipitate hypertensive crisis so its intake should be minimized as well.  At least 14 days should elapse following discontinuation of MAOI therapy before these foods may be consumed.  Specially designed reference materials and dietary consultation are recommended so that an appropriate and safe diet can be planned.  Patients should be advised to promptly seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of a hypertensive crisis such as severe headache, visual disturbances, difficulty thinking, stupor or coma, seizures, chest pain, unexplained nausea or vomiting, and stroke-like symptoms.  Patients should also be counseled not to use MAOIs with alcohol, and to avoid hazardous activities requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination until they know how these agents affect them.","['Pettinger WA, Soyangco FG, Oates JA ""Inhibition of monoamine oxidase in man by furazolidone.""

MANAGEMENT:  Patients receiving CNS-active agents should be warned of this interaction and advised to avoid or limit consumption of alcohol.  Ambulatory patients should be counseled to avoid hazardous activities requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination until they know how these agents affect them, and to notify their physician if they experience excessive or prolonged CNS effects that interfere with their normal activities.","['Warrington SJ, Ankier SI, Turner P ""Evaluation of possible interactions between ethanol and trazodone or amitriptyline.""
